# privatefoodtracker
A simple web based calorie &amp; protein tracker that does not snoop on your data.

**Overview:**
- 🔒 Privately track your calories and protein intake
- 🌎 Run it on your own server or local host or feel free to use my live instance: maxdefroe.nl/ft
- 🌯 Add food items from the list
- 👨‍💻 Or manually enter the calories and protein.

**Food data**
Currently the nutritional database is very limited (food.csv). I will expand in the future. Most data sources for this use data per 100gr and not based on logical servings that work well in real life usage. For example, I want to just click 3 times on cheese slice to add 3 slices each weighing about 5gr, I do not want to add 100 grams or have to type in how many grams the slices weigh. For that reason the current dataset is limited as it needs manual expansion.
